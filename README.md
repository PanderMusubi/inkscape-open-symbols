# Inkscape Open Symbols

**Symbol libraries are sets of SVG symbols located in one SVG document.** For the more technical audience, Inkscape searches for any valid SVG file with symbols (```<symbol>``` element) in your system configuration directory (typically ```share/inkscape```)

## Why use Inkscape Open Symbols?

Inkscape 0.91 includes just five example libraries: Logic Symbols, AIGA/DOT Transportation Symbols, Map Symbols, Flow Chart Shapes, and Word Balloons (made by Martin Owens and Tavmjong Bah).

Inkscape Open Symbols adds a whole lot more!

## How do I install Inkscape Open Symbols?

In [Ubuntu] and [Debian], it is possible to easily install Inkscape Open Symbols with a package manager of your choice. Simply typing `sudo apt-get install inkscape-open-symbols` in a shell will install it for all users.

For other platform or distributions:
1. Grab the icon libraries you need by **cloning the repo** or **downloading the ZIP**. You can also save the SVG files to your system directly from GitHub.
2. Copy the individual SVG files into your Inkscape config folder under the ```symbols``` folder. If it's not there, create it.
  - For OS X and Linux, the local user directory is `~/.config/inkscape/symbols`.
  - For Windows, the local user roaming directory is `%APPDATA%\inkscape\symbols`.
3. Launch Inkscape (close it first if it's already running).
4. Open Symbols from ```Object > symbols``` or press ```Ctrl+Shift+Y```. You should see all icon sets in the "Symbol set" dropdown.

Available in Arch Linux and distributed through [AUR]

[Ubuntu]: https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=inkscape-open-symbols
[Debian]: https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=inkscape-open-symbols
[AUR]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/inkscape-open-symbols-git/

## How can I request new symbols?

Please fill out an issue and provide a SVG reference. If available and well created, it will be fast to generate.

## Why not do it from the UI?

It is perfectly fine to use the Inkscape UI for library development, but they won't be as useful for developers as when they are well generated, minimized and packed for use in production development in some cases.
**Some icons need to be SVG processed in order to be fully useful for both for designers and developers.**

**If you don't need to use it for web development you can watch this cool UI creation video**: [Creating symbol libraries in Inkscape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdaGB0zCdHw)
